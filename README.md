# Numerical-Computation

This repository contains my Numerical Computation course computer assignments at University of Tehran.

## Final Project

In this assignment we use numerical methods like Fourth Order Runge-Kutta and Simpson method for integrals to investigate the series model for infectious disease dynamics and make a guess for total infected people after 5 years based on our aassumptions.
